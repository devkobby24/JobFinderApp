This app uses the JSearch API from RapidAPI to fetch job listings. The API allows for searching jobs by keywords, location, and other parameters.

### Example API Request

```javascript
import axios from 'axios';

const options = {
  method: 'GET',
  url: 'https://jsearch.p.rapidapi.com/search',
  params: {
    query: 'Software Engineer',
    location: 'New York',
    page: '1',
    num_pages: '1',
  },
  headers: {
    'X-RapidAPI-Key': process.env.RAPIDAPI_KEY,
    'X-RapidAPI-Host': 'jsearch.p.rapidapi.com',
  },
};

axios.request(options).then(response => {
  console.log(response.data);
